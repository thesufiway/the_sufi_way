## Who are we?

“**Raah-e-IshQ…The Sufi Way**” is an independent platform for all the seekers of
knowledge
& truth; those who want to understand the deeper meanings of the Deen and implement it
as a transformative tool for the soul and mind (and not just limiting Religion to the
ritualistic practices). The Religion with its essence and meaning would help
individuals achieve higher mystical states; and bring closer to Allah - The Creator.

The concept of ‘*travelling to learn*’ has very much been the part of the Islamic
tradition and can be traced throughout the History of the religion. It has been
practiced and promoted within the classical Islam. Present day renowned Universities
across the Globe has been effectively carrying out such programs for students &
Professionals.

“*Raah-e-IshQ…The Sufi Way*” primarily caters to the Urdu/Hindi speaking audience,
especially in the Indian sub-continent and draws inspiration from Islamic institutions
across the world.

  and regular devotional practices that inculcate discipline and self-awareness.
