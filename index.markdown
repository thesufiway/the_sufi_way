# Come join us!
Come join our caravan and enlighten yourself with the ma’rifat and divine luminosity!
Whoever you’re, whatever actions you’ve committed in the past, it doesn’t matter, this
path of love always remains open and it welcomes you with open arms. “If you’re a
seeker, you’ll be a finder” (Maul-e-Rumi). Seek the divine pearls and treasures in the
endless ocean of knowledge, so be courageous and dive in fearlessly. This is
“Raahe-IshQ”, the sufi way of achieving the ultimate purpose of life. The Sufi
Masha’ikhs maintain the balance of Ishq (Love), Ilm (Knowledge) and Aql (intelligence)
and they are the flag-bearer of truth and a guide for every seeker without exceptions
and discriminations.
