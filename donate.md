intro: 
  - excerpt: 'The example of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like a seed [of
grain] which grows seven spikes; in each spike is a hundred grains. And Allah
multiplies [His reward] for whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and
all-Knowing.'

This is a first of its kind initiative in India which needs your active support not
just financial but also in terms of participation. We’ve kept the access free for the
first event to spread the word amongst the seekers of sacred knowledge, however, it
would be really appreciative if you could monetarily contribute towards the cost of
these activities. Please support generously.
