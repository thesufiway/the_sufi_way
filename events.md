## Reconnecting to our Roots (2021)

The first event *Reconnecting to our Roots* was successfully executed December-2021
with a limited group of Professionals from various backgrounds including Research
scientists, Engineers and Chartered Accountants. It was a 2-day program covering
foundational aspects of the three dimensions of Religion - Islam, Imaan, and Ehsaan -
as outlined in the famous hadith of Jibril (upon him be peace). Two primary faculties
namely Maulana Ziyaur Rahman Alimi and Dr. Zeeshan Ahmed Misbahi hailing from North
India associated with a renowned educational Institution Jamia Arifia brilliantly
piloted the sessions which also had couple of Group discussions. Jamia Arifia (U.P
India) is known for its quality education, research works, publications and its MoU
with Al-Azhar University (Cairo, Egypt). Day-1 sessions covered Dars-e-Hadith-e-Jibril
followed by sessions covering Imaan and Islam. A fruitful session on ‘Who are Ahle
Sunnah wal-Jamaat’ and an elaborate group discussion on ‘Takfirism as a prevalent
issue’, was carried out. Day-2 was dedicated to Ehsaan (i.e. Excellence), Tasawwuf as a
science, Sufism vs Ritualism followed by clarifications on doubts regarding Sufism.
Managed by a handful passionate individuals, the spiritual-intellectual journey to
Islam was thoroughly enjoyed by the audience and almost every individual experienced
some share of the magnificence and enormity of Deen Al-Islam. The event was concluded
with certificate distribution and an immersive Dua which ended on a spiritually high
note for all.

The event has been professionally recorded and the 2-day course is readily available
for all the seekers at a very discounted rate (details below). Raah-e-IshQ …The Sufi
